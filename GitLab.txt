Work with a partner on one of your computers. Download this text file and fill it out as
you go. When you're done, switch to the other partner's computer and do it again.

Use Terminal (on Mac) or Git Bash (on Windows) and your favorite text editor to complete
the following. Wherever you see a >>>, record what command you used to complete that step.
If you used multiple commands, write all the command you used.
Wherever you see a ???, write a short answer to the question.

1. Create a new folder
>>> mkdir lab-git

2. Make that folder into a local Git repository
>>> git init

3. Add a new empty file called story.txt
>>> touch story.txt

4. Open that file in a text editor.
>>> open story.txt

5. Add an opening paragraph to story.txt. Save it. The file should be at least several
lines long.

6. Create another file called authors.txt. Add your names to it and save it.

7. Commit only story.txt, with commit message "Initial Commit".
>>> git add story.txt
git commit -m "Initial Commit"

8. What is the status of story.txt and what is the status of authors.txt at this point?
??? story.txt: untracked
??? authors.txt: untracked

9. Add a bit to your story in a text editor and save it. What is the status of story.txt now?
modified:   story.txt

10. Stage story.txt for the next commit.
git add story.txt

11. Stage authors.txt for the next commit.
 git add authors.txt

12. One second thought, unstage authors.txt. We don't want to commit it yet.
git reset HEAD authors.txt

13. Hmm. On third thought, yeah, let's stage it after all.
git add authors.txt

14. Now commit both staged files. (message = "extended story and added authors")
git commit -m "extended story and added authors"

15. Set up a GitHub repository and push this latest commit to that repo.
echo "# GitLabJJ" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/RedEis91/GitLabJJ.git
git push -u origin master

16. One of you make a change to one of the files while the other is not looking. Don't
stage or commit.

17. The other of you use Git's command line tools to figure out what file is changed and
what is changed about it. (You must use at least two different commands in your
investigation.)
git status
git diff

18. Now undo the change that was made.
git checkout 

19. Add a bogus author. Save and stage.
git add authors.txt

20. Can you use git tools to see that change?
git diff --staged

21. Nevermind that. Now completely undo that change so that you're back to the real
authors from the last commit.
git reset authors.txt
git reset --hard b2eae72a6f66b56964d280bd8e0811d8c3efbc0b

22. Add another couple sentences to your story and commit.
git add story.txt
git commit -m "Added updated story of our glory"


23. Delete authors.txt and commit that.
git commit -m "you better take my commit jerk"

24. List all the commits.

    Initial Commit
Macks-MacBook-Air:Git-Lab Red$ 


25. You're reminiscing about the good 'ol days of seeing your names in text. Switch back
to the commit where authors.txt existed so you can gaze upon it one more time.
git reset --hard 86202eb625e9d9184689786bccbc92b8a2575ab9

26. But the past is the past. Return to the HEAD commit.
git reset --hard ee063a28c4c11a6fbba422ba8c5dacddeed641ed

27. Add this file (Git Lab.txt) to your folder and commit it.

28. Push your latest changes to the GitHub.

*** Bonus below...
29. Make and commit another change to your story.
>>> 

30. You're experiencing remorse for removing attribution. You can't live with yourself.
Bring back authors.txt from the past in a new commit on top of your new story changes.
Explain how you pulled this off, including any commands.
??? 

31. Commit you latest changes to this file (Git Lab.txt) and push to GitHub.
